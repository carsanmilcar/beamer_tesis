	abstract     = {{Ma has shown that, in the case of an exponential potential, in the s‐wave S matrix there exist poles that do not contribute to the completeness, even though they appear in the same part of the k plane as the bound state poles. These poles were called ``redundant'' poles. Subsequently, other examples of redundant poles have appeared in the literature. Recently their importance with regard to the concept of ``shadow'' states has been stressed by Sudarshan. If we construct the Green's function for the {Schrödinger} equation with the boundary conditions of regularity at the origin and the outgoing spherical waves at large distances, the singularities of it in the k plane completely determine the L2 class of eigensolutions. From this Green's function, the T matrix (and hence the S matrix) is constructed explicitly. This S matrix is found to be the same as the one defined through the usual Jost solution, and it is shown that the singularities of the S matrix, besides corresponding to those appearing in the Green's function, also contain the ``redundant'' singularities. Thus it is shown that the wavefunctions associated with the ``redundant'' singularities do not belong to the L2 class. By a careful derivation, we resolve the Ma paradox concerning the Heisenberg identity. In the particular cases of the exponential potential and the Eckart potential, the redundant solutions correspond to the vanishing of a Wronskian pointing to the breakdown of the linear independence of the starting wavefunctions in defining the S matrix through the Jost functions. It is stressed that when singularities appear in the S matrix other than those corresponding to the bound and scattering states of the given problem, the ``redundant'' singularities can only be understood by a ``dynamical'' equation such as the {Schrödinger} equation.}},

	abstract     = {The new quantum mechanics, when applied to the problem of the structure of the atom with point-charge electrons, does not give results in agreement with experiment. The discrepancies consist of “duplexity ” phenomena, the observed number of stationary states for an electron in an atom being twice the number given by the theory. To meet the difficulty, Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck have introduced the idea of an electron with a spin angular momentum of half a quantum and a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton. This model for the electron has been fitted into the new mechanics by Pauli,* and Darwin,† working with an equivalent theory, has shown that it gives results in agreement with experiment for hydrogen-like spectra to the first order of accuracy. The question remains as to why Nature should have chosen this particular model for the electron instead of being satisfied with the point-charge. One would like to find some incompleteness in the previous methods of applying quantum mechanics to the point-charge electron such that, when removed, the whole of the duplexity phenomena follow without arbitrary assumptions. In the present paper it is shown that this is the case, the incompleteness of the previous theories lying in their disagreement with relativity, or, alternatetively, with the general transformation theory of quantum mechanics. It appears that the simplest Hamiltonian for a point-charge electron satisfying the requirements of both relativity and the general transformation theory leads to an explanation of all duplexity phenomena without further assumption. All the same there is a great deal of truth in the spinning electron model, at least as a first approximation. The most important failure of the model seems to be that the magnitude of the resultant orbital angular momentum of an electron moving in an orbit in a central field of force is not a constant, as the model leads one to expect.}

As a result, one-step regular rational extensions of the latter depending both on an integer index n and on a continuously varying parameter λ are constructed.

In order to achieve it, one generally needs to solve an indefinite integral, which limits the actual systems to which it can be applied. Nevertheless, not so long ago, an alternative method to achieve this transformation was developed through a Wronskian differential formula (Bermudez et al., 2012). In the present work, we consider the k-confluent SUSY transformation, where k factorization energies merge into a single value, and we develop a generalized Wronskian differential formula for this case. Furthermore, we explicitly work out general formulas for the third- and fourth-order cases and we present as examples the free particle and the single-gap Lamé potentials.}

abstract = {The dynamical algebra associated with a family of isospectral oscillator Hamiltonians is studied through the analysis of its representation in the basis of energy eigenstates. It is shown that this representation becomes similar to that of the standard Heisenberg algebra, and it is dependent on a parameter omega &gt;or=0. We call it the distorted Heisenberg algebra, where omega is the distortion parameter. The corresponding coherent states for an arbitrary omega are derived, and some particular examples are discussed in detail. A prescription to produce the squeezing, by adequately selecting the initial state of the system, is given.}

abstract = {This work studies a variety of factorizations for the radial isotropic oscillator Hamiltonian leading to a hierarchy of radial Hamiltonians labeled by a discrete index. These results are applied to find a relationship between the ladder operators (which allow one to move in the eigenfunction space of a fixed Hamiltonian) and shift operators (that connect eigenfunctions of different Hamiltonians inside the factorization hierarchy). The operators appearing in the factorizations span a dynamical algebra whose action is schematically drawn on a two-dimensional lattice. Afterwards it is shown in detail that the relevant subalgebra is isomorphic to an extended (1+2) Newton–Hooke conformal algebra corresponding to a two-dimensional wave equation. As a byproduct, for each element of the hierarchy there is derived a new one-parametric continuous family of almost-isospectral radial Hamiltonians.}

First of all, we classify these self-adjoint extensions in terms of several choices of the parameters determining each of the extensions. There are essentially two big groups of extensions. In one, the ground state has strictly positive energy. On the other, either the ground state has zero or negative energy. In the present paper, we show that each of the extensions belonging to the first group (energy of ground state strictly positive) has an infinite sequence of supersymmetric partners, such that the ℓ-th order partner differs in one energy level from both the (ℓ−1)-th and the (ℓ+1)-th order partners. In general, the eigenvalues for each of the self-adjoint extensions of −d2/dx2 come from a transcendental equation and are all infinite. For the case under our study, we determine the eigenvalues, which are also infinite, all the extensions have a purely discrete spectrum, and their respective eigenfunctions for all of its ℓ-th supersymmetric partners of each extension.}

The existence of self adjoint determinations with a ground state of zero or even negative energy is a proved fact. In this paper, we analyze the possibility of constructing SUSY partners for those determinations. We also study those cases for which the ground state has a degeneracy, the study of their SUSY partners should be analyzed separately. So far, we have studied those determinations having an exactly solvable eigenvalue problem. On the present study, we also included some comments in relation to determinations not exactly solvable from this point of view. In addition, the use of self adjoint determinations for which the ground state wave function has nodes (zeroes) produces formal SUSY partners with a finite number of eigenvalues or even with a purely continuous spectrum. We give some worked examples of these situations.}

abstract = { The simplest purely imaginary and piecewise constant \${\mathcal{PT}}\$-symmetric potential located inside a larger box is studied. Unless its strength exceeds a certain critical value, all the spectrum of its bound states remains real and discrete. We interpret such a model as an initial element of the generalized non-Hermitian Witten's hierarchy of solvable Hamiltonians and construct its first supersymmetric partner in closed form. }

The analytic continuation of the scattering matrix in the momentum representation has a branch cut and an infinite number of simple poles on the negative imaginary axis which are related with the so called anti-bound states. This model does not show resonances. Using the wave functions of the anti-bound states, we obtain supersymmetric (SUSY) partners which are the series of Rosen–Morse II potentials. We have computed the Wigner reflection and transmission time delays for the hyperbolic step and such SUSY partners. Our results show that the more bound states a partner Hamiltonian has the smaller is the time delay. We also have evaluated time delays for the hyperbolic step potential in the classical case and have obtained striking similitudes with the quantum case.}

In some cases, there are even bound states and this depends on the values of given parameters. Then, we perform different supersymmetric transformations on the original Hamiltonian using either the ground state (for those situations where there are bound states) wave functions, or other solutions that come from anti-bound states or redundant states. We study the properties of these transformations.}

Any REQHO system is characterized by the number of separated states in its spectrum, the number of ‘valence bands’ in which the separated states are organized, and by the total number of the missing energy levels and their position. All these peculiarities of a REQHO system are shown to be detected and reflected by a trinity , ,  of the basic (primary) lowering and raising ladder operators related between themselves by certain algebraic identities with coefficients polynomially-dependent on the Hamiltonian. We show that all the secondary, higher-order ladder operators are obtainable by a composition of the basic ladder operators of the trinity which form the set of the spectrum-generating operators. Each trinity, in turn, can be constructed from the intertwining operators of the two complementary minimal schemes of the Darboux–Crum–Krein–Adler transformations.}

abstract = {We consider some special reductions of generic Darboux–Crum dressing formulae and of their difference versions. As a matter of fact, we obtain some new formulae for Darboux–{Pöschl}–{Teller} (DPT) potentials by means of Wronskian determinants. For their difference deformations (called DDPT-I and DDPT-II potentials) and the related eigenfunctions, we obtain new formulae described by the ratios of Casorati determinants given by the functional difference generalization of the Darboux–Crum dressing formula.}

abstract = {We consider the descendants of self-adjointly extended Hamiltonians in supersymmetric quantum mechanics on a half-line, on an interval, and on a punctured line or interval. While there is a 4-parameter family of self-adjointly extended Hamiltonians on a punctured line, only a 3-parameter sub-family has supersymmetric descendants that are themselves self-adjoint. We also address the self-adjointness of an operator related to the supercharge, and point out that only a sub-class of its most general self-adjoint extensions is physical. Besides a general characterization of self-adjoint extensions and their supersymmetric descendants, we explicitly consider concrete examples, including a particle in a box with general boundary conditions, with and without an additional point interaction. We also discuss bulk-boundary resonances and their manifestation in the supersymmetric descendant.}
